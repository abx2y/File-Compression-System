# File-Compression-System

## Description
This project implements a file compression and decompression tool using Huffman coding. Huffman coding is an efficient method for lossless data compression that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies.

## Features
- **File Compression**: Compresses a given text file using Huffman coding.
- **File Decompression**: Restores the original text file from the compressed format.
- **Huffman Tree Construction**: Builds a binary tree based on the frequency of characters in the input file.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Data Structures: Priority Queue, Trees
- File Handling

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-compression-tool.git
   cd file-compression-tool
